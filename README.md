# Keiran Haax

Creative developer building at the intersection of design, sound, and software.
I make iOS apps, CLI tools, and things that feel considered.

Based in New Hampshire.

## Current Projects

**[Fonic HiFi](https://github.com/keiranhaax/fonic-hifi)** — An audiophile music player for iOS. Bit-perfect lossless playback, multi-engine audio architecture (AVAudioEngine + AudioKit), gapless transitions, and a privacy-first design with zero network access. Built with Swift, SwiftUI, and SwiftData.

**[halie-cli](https://github.com/keiranhaax/halie-cli)** — AI-powered terminal assistant with dual agent modes: a coder for file ops and repo analysis, and a researcher for deep web search and synthesis. Built with TypeScript and Ink.

**[mrktr](https://github.com/keiranhaax/mrktr)** — Terminal-based price research tool for resellers. Compares listings across eBay, Mercari, Amazon, and Facebook Marketplace with real-time analytics and profit calculators. Built with Go and Bubble Tea.
