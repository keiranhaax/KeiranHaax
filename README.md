> I build things that feel grounded, honest, and distraction-free, tools that respect your space, your data, and your attention.

## Projects

- 🎵 **[Fonic HiFi](https://github.com/keiranhaax/fonic-hifi-app)** — Audiophile music player for iOS. Bit-perfect lossless playback up to 32-bit/384kHz, gapless transitions, zero network access. Privacy by design — no analytics, no cloud, no permissions you didn't ask for.

- 🩺 **[Halie App](https://github.com/keiranhaax/Halie-App)** — iOS health monitoring with 40+ metrics, recovery scoring, and an AI health coach powered by Apple Foundation Models. All on-device, zero cloud dependency.

- 🤖 **[halie-cli](https://github.com/keiranhaax/halie-cli)** — AI terminal assistant with a split personality: `/coder` for repo surgery, `/researcher` for deep web synthesis with multi-source search and crash recovery.

- 📊 **[mrktr](https://github.com/keiranhaax/mrktr)** — Reseller price research from the terminal. Searches eBay, Mercari, Amazon, and Facebook Marketplace simultaneously with TF-IDF query expansion and profit calculators. Go + Bubble Tea.

- 🎮 **[trade-projectGS](https://github.com/keiranhaax/trade-projectGS)** — GameStop trade-in value checker. Batch-process 20+ games with smart caching, retry logic, and CSV export. Python + Firecrawl.

- 🧠 **ADHD Assist** *(coming soon)* — Assistive technology platform for people with ADHD. Personalized cognitive aids and adaptive productivity tools powered by on-device ML. Building this because I need it.
## What Drives the Work

- **Photography shapes my interfaces** — I think in film tones, negative space, and timing before I think in components. The film color science taught me more about UI than any design system.
- **ADHD is a feature, not a bug** — Hyperfocus is a superpower when pointed at the right problem. I'm building tools for brains like mine.
- **Privacy is non-negotiable** — If your data leaves the device, there better be a damn good reason.
- **On-device intelligence** — CoreML, Foundation Models, and keeping inference where it belongs: in your hands.

<summary>A few more things</summary>

- Currently exploring how on-device ML can adapt interfaces in real-time for neurodivergent users
- Photography shapes how I think about interfaces
- I reach for Figma before I reach for Xcode
- The best UI is the one you don't notice
