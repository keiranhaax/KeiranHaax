> I build things that feel grounded, honest, and distraction-free, tools that respect your space, your data, and your attention.

## Projects

- 🎵 **[Fonic HiFi](https://github.com/keiranhaax/fonic-hifi)** — Audiophile music player for iOS. Bit-perfect lossless playback up to 32-bit/384kHz. Multi-engine architecture (AVAudioEngine + AudioKit), gapless transitions, zero network access. Built with Swift 6, SwiftUI, and SwiftData.

- 🤖 **[halie-cli](https://github.com/keiranhaax/halie-cli)** — AI terminal assistant with split personality: `/coder` for repo surgery, `/researcher` for deep web synthesis. Multi-source search (Exa, Tavily, Brave), session persistence, crash recovery.

- 📊 **[mrktr](https://github.com/keiranhaax/mrktr)** — Reseller price research from the terminal. Searches eBay, Mercari, Amazon, and Facebook Marketplace simultaneously. TF-IDF query expansion, profit calculators, vim-style navigation. Built with Go and Bubble Tea.

## What Drives the Work

- **Photography shapes my interfaces** — I think in film tones, negative space, and timing before I think in components. The film color science taught me more about UI than any design system.
- **ADHD is a feature, not a bug** — Hyperfocus is a superpower when pointed at the right problem. I'm building tools for brains like mine.
- **Privacy is non-negotiable** — If your data leaves the device, there better be a damn good reason.
- **On-device intelligence** — CoreML, Foundation Models, and keeping inference where it belongs: in your hands.

<summary>A few more things</summary>

- Currently exploring how on-device ML can adapt interfaces in real-time for neurodivergent users
- Photography shapes how I think about interfaces
- I reach for Figma before I reach for Xcode
- The best UI is the one you don't notice
